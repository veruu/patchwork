    Added /comments endpoint. For comment list, fields
        'id', 'url', 'msgid', 'date', 'subject', 'submitter', 'parent', 'tags'
    are available. For comment detail (/comments/29), comment's
        'content', 'headers', 'project'
    are added as well. Filtering is possible based on
        'project', 'parent', 'submitter'
    fields.
