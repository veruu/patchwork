features:
  - |
    Allow list filtering into multiple projects (and email dropping) based on
    subject prefixes. Enable by specifying a regular expression which needs to
    be matched in the subject on a per-project basis (field `subject_match`).
    Project with empty `subject_match` field (and matching `list_id`) serves as
    a default in case of no match.
api:
  - |
    Expose `subject_match` in REST API.
