    Tagging is completely reworked. Instead of counts, real values are         
    extracted. This fixes wrong counts when for example the same person        
    accidentally sent the Acked-by email twice, since only a single same pair  
    tagname-value can be assigned to a patch. Tags from cover letters are now  
    counted towards each patch in the series.
api:
  - |
    The ``tags`` field of the ``/patches`` is now populated and an equivalent
    field is added for the cover letters and comments. Tags are listed as
    key-value pairs, making it easier to find where a specific tag originated
    from.
  - |
    Tag filtering on patches and cover letter using ``?tag=<name>:<value>`` is
    now supported. <name> or <value> can also be missing or wildcard ``*`` in
    case all tags with given attribute are wanted. For example,
    ``?tag=Acked-by:*`` returns all patches / cover letters which were acked.
upgrade:

    The ``retag`` command (``python manage.py retag``) needs to be ran after   
    the upgrade. The migration only takes care of the database structure, while
    the actual tag data will be created by the command, to make the migration  
    itself faster. Please note that this will take a lot of time and based on  
    the size of the data in question, might be useful to run in batches.
